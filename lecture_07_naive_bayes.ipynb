Such a model is either a pure or traditional discriminative model if it is deterministic and aims to fit the training set in some optimall way, or a conditional model if it is probabilistic in nature, such as the conditional probability $p(y\\vert{\\bf x})$. The model parameters in ${\\bf\\theta}$ are obtained in some optimal way based on the training set. Then prediction can be made for any unlabeled ${\\bf x}$ in terms of the corresponding $y$.

There is not a single algorithm for training such classifiers, but a family of algorithms based on a common principle: all naive Bayes classifiers assume that the value of a particular feature is independent of the value of any other feature, given the class variable. For example, a fruit may be considered to be an apple if it is red, round, and about $10 \\text{cm}$ in diameter.
